## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To build the project, the following prerequisites must be met:

- Node.js, at least v14.16 or v16 LTS (see [https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/))

If you want to use Docker instead, take a look at the [Docker environment](#docker-environment) section.

### Installation

Change to this directory, e.g.:

```bash
cd databrowser
```

Copy the file `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust the configuration parameters if required.

Install the dependencies (if not already installed):

```bash
npm install
```

### Start development

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

On successful start, the demo application can be found at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Build and deploy

> Before proceeding, please ensure that you are in the databrowser directory.

Build the production version:

```bash
npm run build
```

The result, found in the `./dist` folder, can be deployed to a web server.

Launch local production server:

```bash
npm run start
```

## Docker environment

> Before proceeding, please ensure that you are in the databrowser directory.

For the project a Docker environment is already prepared and ready to use with all necessary prerequisites.

These Docker containers are the same as used by the continuous integration servers.

In order to use the Docker environment, you must have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) installed
locally on your machine, together with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

### Start and stop the containers

Before start working you have to start the Docker containers:

```bash
docker-compose up --build --detach
```

After finished working you can stop the Docker containers:

```bash
docker-compose stop
```

### Running commands inside the container

When the containers are running, you can execute any command inside the environment. Just replace the dots `...` in the following example with the command you wish to execute:

```bash
docker-compose exec node /bin/bash -c "..."
```

Some examples are:

```bash
docker-compose exec node /bin/bash -c "npm install"

# or

docker-compose exec node /bin/bash -c "npm run dev"

# or

docker-compose exec node /bin/bash -c "npm run build"
```
